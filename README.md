# Live-Covid-19-cases-dashboard-using-PowerBi
In this project, I have created a live dashboard of covid-19 cases using Microsoft PowerBi. I have taken data from worldometer with the help of API.
There are cards, bargraphs, pie charts,donut chart and maps.Each representing the other parameters like TotalCases, ActiveCases, TotalDealths, Total Recoveries,Average cases per day by country,etc.
This dashboard is interactive.
